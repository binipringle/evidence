Dowling v. U.S. (1990) illustrates preliminary questions (Rule 104) (Dowling accused of robbing a bank wearing a ski mask; judge allowed prosecution to bring evidence that Dowling tried to rob a house two weeks later wearing a ski mask even though Dowling was acquitted in the house robbery where there was reasonable doubt [highest standard of proof] because a reasonable jury could still find by a preponderance of the evidence [more likely than not] that Dowling robbed the house)

U.S. v. Roger Stone (USDC for District of Columbia, 2019) illustrates relevance (Rule 401) (Movie clip from the Godfather is relevant to place defendant’s statements about Frank Panganeli in context by showing the jury the image that Stone intended to evoke in Person 2’s mind when he named Panganeli)

Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs., Inc. (Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, 2012) illustrates relevance (Rule 401) (motion in limine to bar plaintiff from presenting video and in-court demonstrations of SawStop Technology on model not substantially similar to model that caused injury denied without prejudice because SawStop functions in the same manner on both models and the probative value of the demonstration could substantially outweigh the danger of any unfair prejudice)

U.S. v. Boros (7th Cir. 2012) illustrates relevance (Rule 401) (admission of doctor’s testimony about types of medications Boros sold over internet had minimal relevance and low probative value but trial court allowed because provided context for jury so it met the low bar for relevance)

State v. Poe, 21 Utah 113 (1968) illustrates prejudice (Rule 403) (Trial court abused discretion in admitting gruesome colored slides from autopsy because identity and cause of death was already established with black and white photographs and color slides were only offered by prosecution to inflame and arouse the jury so that they would recommend the death sentence rather than life imprisonment; reversed and remanded because of abuse of discretion and “other doubtful aspects of the trial”)

Haley, v. Gross, McKee, and Ellis, 86 F.3d 630 (7th Cir. 1996) illustrates prejudice (Rule 403) (trial court did not abuse discretion by admitting photograph of burned cell with dead body of Haley’s cellmate because while disturbing, its contents were highly relevant, and its very significant probative value was not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice; nor did trial court abuse discretion by admitting photograph of Haley in hospital severely burned and with leg shackles because not prejudicial)

Old Chief illustrates prejudice (Rule 403) (court reinforced general rule that parties can always present evidence even if other side is willing to stipulate to the evidence. But can also use 403 to say in a particular case the evidence should have been stipulated to because was unfairly prejudicial given the specific facts of the case.)

U.S. v. Boros illustrates prejudice (Rule 403) (dry testimony of doctor barely relevant but relevant because charge is conspiracy to import controlled substances. Prosecutor’s mistake was to use it in summation and talk about how people could have had miscarriages, could have died, which doesn’t have anything to do with the charge. Court says evidence not very probative but very prejudicial because people dying, having miscarriages.)

Kemp v. Balboa 23 F.3d 211 (8th Cir. 1994) illustrates witness competency (Rules 601, 602, 602) (court did not allow prison nurse’s testimony to prove that Kemp did not pick up epilepsy medication because nurse had no personal knowledge since her testimony was based only on review of Kemp’s medical file)

United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006) illustrates witness competency (Rules 601, 602, 602) (Kelly did not raise the issue of competency at trial, so appellate court reviews district court’s decision for plain error)

United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006) illustrates prior inconsistent statement Rule 613(b) (child’s tape-recorded testimony admissible as prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b). Rule 613(b) only states that a witness be afforded the opportunity to explain; it does not require a witness to actually explain or deny the prior inconsistent statements. Here, the child had the opportunity to explain himself, and Kelly had the opportunity to cross-examine the child. Moreover, although Kelly complains that the tape-recorded statement was used for substantive purposes, there is no evidence it was introduced for anything but impeachment of the witness.)

Taylor v. Cheddar’s Casual Cafe, Inc. 2017 WL 157886 (W.D. La 2017)(unreported) illustrates prior inconsistent statement Rule 613(b) (evidence of Young’s alleged theft from Cheddar’s is inadmissible because Young neither charged with nor convicted of a crime based on this allegation and there is no other relevant purpose for the admission of this evidence.) (Young’s statements to Cheddar’s’ management and the two insurance adjusters after Taylor’s fall at the restaurant are inadmissible as hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but nonetheless admissible for the purpose of impeachment by prior inconsistent statement.)

United States v. Abel 469 U.S. 45 (1984) illustrates bias (Extrinsic evidence to show bias is Ehle’s testimony that Ehle, Mills and Abel [defendant accused of bank robbery] were members of a secret prison organization whose members took an oath to deny its existence and “lie, cheat, steal [and] kill” to protect each other. Evidence offered by prosecution to rebut Mills [defendant’s witness]’s testimony that prior to Ehle’s testimony incriminating Abel, Ehle had told Mills that he [Ehle] was going to testify falsely against Abel. Prosecution brings extrinsic evidence of membership in secret prison organization to demonstrate that Mills is potentially biased in favor of Abel.)

Renda v. King 347 F.3d 550 (3d Cir. 2003) illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608) (district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Trooper King’s good character for truthfulness because Renda attacked King’s character for truthfulness by arguing during her opening statement that the jury should not believe King not because of bias but because he was corrupt and improperly performed his official duties.)

United States v. Jones, 763 F.2d 518, 522 (2d Cir. 1985) illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608) (holding that attacks on a witness’s character for truthfulness in opening statements may qualify under the “otherwise” portion of Rule 608(a)).

United States v. Martinez 923 F.3d 806 (10th Cir. 2019) illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608) (no abuse of discretion in district court’s exclusion of defendant’s character-for-truthfulness evidence; the clear purpose of the prosecutor’s cross-examination was challenge defendant’s veracity with respect to a specific issue in the present case [his intent], not his general truthfulness. See Kauz, 188 F.2d at 10 [“The mere fact that a witness is contradicted by other evidence in the case does not constitute an attack upon his reputation for truth and veracity”]. “If this be an attack on Defendant’s character for truthfulness, then such an attack occurs whenever the prosecution puts on evidence contrary to a witness’s account.”)

Hunter-McLeod v. Dollar Gen., Eastern District of Pennsylvania 2014 U.S. District. LEXIS 129177, CIVIL ACTION NO. 13-3113 (E.D. Pennsylvania, 2014) illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407) (video surveillance footage showing store employee putting cardboard on the floor where plaintiff fell is inadmissible as evidence of subsequent remedial measures because it does not directly contradict employee’s witness testimony.)

Parents and Estate of John Hill v. Konnecranes, Inc. and Morris Material Handling, Inc., 2019 WL 3842072 (2019) illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407) (policies and procedures not admitted for impeachment purposes because defendants expect that plaintiffs will rely on these policies and procedures for “more than” impeachment purposes)

Complaint of Consolidation Coal Co., 123 F.3d at 137 (3d Cir. 1997) illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407) (Evidence of subsequent remedial measures for impeachment purposes “must contradict the witness’s testimony directly” to be admissible)

Kelly v. Crown Equip. Co., 970 F.2d 1273, 1278 (3d Cir. 1992) illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407) (evidence of subsequent design changes inadmissible where expert testified that previous design was excellent and proper, not that it was the best or only possible design)

Anderson v. Malloy, 700 F.2d 1208, 1211-12 (8th Cir.1983) illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407) (evidence of subsequent remedial measures admitted to impeach statements that defendants had done everything necessary for a secure motel and that chain locks and peep holes would not be successful, when defendants took additional security measures after incident and installed those devices).

Weems v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 665 F.3d 958 (C.A 8th Cir. 2011) illustrates compromise offers and negotiations (Rule 408) (district court violated Rule 408 by admitting into evidence a separation agreement and related testimony and this error likely materially influenced the jury’s verdict)

MCI Communs. Servs. v. Hagan, 641 F.3d 112 (5th Cir. 2011) illustrates compromise offers and negotiations (Rule 408) (testimony about phone call asking how much damaged cable would cost was not excluded under Rule 408 because there was not yet an actual dispute)

United States v. Chang 999 F,3d 1059 (C.A. 7th 2021) illustrates statement against interest exception to rule against hearsay (Court barred Lola Chang’s self-incriminating statements exculpating Ely Lao where they had been arrested in a car that broke down on the highway and cops found drugs and illegally modified guns in the car, because the court found her statements untrustworthy because either coerced [cops thought maybe partner abuse] or for affection [cops thought Chang and Lao were “culturally” married] and because other evidence contradicted what Chang said)

Baines v. Walgreen 863 F.3d 656 (7th Cir. 2007) illustrates opposing party’s statement made by agent or employee; also illustrates hearsay within hearsay (Baines allowed to admit Martin’s statement that Ruehs stated that Birch told Ruehs not to hire Baines because Martin was a Walgreen’s employee and Ruehs was her supervisor and statements were within the scope of employment, and because innermost level of testimony [what Birch said to Ruehs] was not a statement but a command)  

Crawford v. Washington 541 US 36 (2004) shifted application of confrontation clause (unexamined testimonial ex parte statements against defendant is what the confrontation clause bars)

Davis v. Washington 547 US 813 (2006) narrowed application of confrontation clause (hearsay statements made in 911 call asking for aid were not “testimonial” because they were seeking help, not made for a prosecutorial purpose) (since Davis, statements are only testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to criminal prosecution)

Michigan v. Bryant 562 US 344 (2011) narrowed application of Davis primary purpose test (Covington wounded and dying in gas station parking lot, told police that Bryant shot him outside Bryant’s house; police testimony inadmissible under confrontation clause because police asked questions for the purpose of catching Bryant, and there was no ongoing emergency because Covington had left the area where Bryant had shot him)

Bullcoming v. New Mexico 564 US 647 (2011) illustrates lab report testimonial for confrontation clause (lab analyst who analyzed blood alcohol test taken under a search warrant was required to take the stand; second surrogate analyst could not testify in analyst’s place)

Melendez-Diaz v. Massachussetts 557 US 305 (2009) illustrates lab report testimonial for confrontation clause (police seized around 28 grams of cocaine from Walmart employee and sent for analysis; lab report testimonial so analyst required in court)
