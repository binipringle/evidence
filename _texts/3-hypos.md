## Rule 201 Judicial Notice

Most highly tested area is jury instruction. Rule: **In a civil case**, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. **In a criminal case**, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.

A defendant is accused of burglary, defined by statute as “the breaking and entering of a dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony therein.” The prosecution requests that the judge take judicial notice of the following facts: (1) that the sun set at 7:52 P.M. on the day of the burglary; (2) that all of the buildings on the block with that address that was burglarized are zoned residential; and (3) that most people lock their doors when leaving their homes.

- Which facts should the judge take judicial notice of?
- What instructions should the jury be given regarding facts judicially noticed?

Answer: **May** take judicial notice of (1) time of sunset and (2) zoned residential area. **May not** take judicial notice of fact that most people lock their doors. Because it is a criminal case, the jury **may** accept judicially noticed facts but are **not required** to accept judicially noticed facts as conclusive.*

A man was on trial for the murder of his boss in New York City. The boss was killed at 3:00 P.M. on Saturday, June 3rd. At the start of the trial, the man testified that he went to visit his sick friend in the hospital on the day in question. The man testified that since he did not have a car, he took New Jersey Transit to get to Newark, New Jersey to visit his sick friend. The man’s attorney requested that the court take judicial notice that New Jersey Transit only had one train on Saturday and that it left New York’s Penn Station at 2:45 P.M., Saturday, June 3rd, and presented a ticket as well as a New Jersey Transit Timetable into evidence. The court thereafter took judicial notice of the time of the train’s departure.

Was the court’s action proper?

- (A)	Yes, because the time of the train’s departure was not subject to reasonable dispute.
- (B)	Yes, because the request for judicial notice occurred during the beginning of trial.
- (C)	No, because this type of fact is not generally known within the jurisdiction.
- (D)	No, because no facts were presented to indicate that the man was actually on the train.

*The correct answer is A. The defendant has an alibi defense. The defendant’s attorney requests the court take judicial notice and supplies the necessary information (the train’s published timetable). The court shall take judicial notice because the time of the train was not subject to reasonable dispute.*

## Rule 403 Unfair Prejudice

# Hypo

A decedent is killed when the car that the decedent is driving is hit by a tractor-trailer owned by a trucking company. The employee is also killed in the accident. The decedent’s family sues the trucking company and seeks to have evidence admitted that the employee’s blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.24% (more than twice the legal limit) at the time of the accident. If the company objects to introduction of the BAC, how should the judge rule?

*Blood Alcohol Level is relevant both to the issues of fault by the driver and third-party liability. It is not unfairly prejudicial, therefore admissible.*
