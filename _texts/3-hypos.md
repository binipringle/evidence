## Rule 201 Judicial Notice

Most highly tested area is jury instruction. Rule: **In a civil case**, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. **In a criminal case**, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.

Hypo: A defendant is accused of burglary, defined by statute as “the breaking and entering of a dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony therein.” The prosecution requests that the judge take judicial notice of the following facts: (1) that the sun set at 7:52 P.M. on the day of the burglary; (2) that all of the buildings on the block with that address that was burglarized are zoned residential; and (3) that most people lock their doors when leaving their homes.

- Which facts should the judge take judicial notice of?
- What instructions should the jury be given regarding facts judicially noticed?

Answer: MAY take judicial notice of (1) time of sunset and (2) zoned residential area. May not take judicial notice of fact that most people lock their doors. Because it is a criminal case, the jury MAY accept judicially noticed facts but are NOT required to accept judicially noticed facts as conclusive.
